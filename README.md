This interactive game "Littel Talkers" helps children learn English through engaging levels themed around popular TV shows: **SpongeBob**, **PJ Masks**, **Winx Club**, and **Spidey and His Amazing Friends**. Players create a personalized character by uploading a close-up photo, which is transformed into a TV show-inspired avatar using AI. The game features multiple levels, incorporating sentence completion, listening comprehension, and speech practice activities that progressively become more challenging.

### Features

1. **Personalized Character Creation**:
   - Players upload a photo of themselves.
   - The game uses the **IP Adapter FaceID Plus demo** to create an avatar dressed as a character from the selected TV show.

2. **Themed Levels**:
   - **Sentence Completion**: Choose the correct words to complete sentences related to the TV show.
   - **Listening Comprehension**: Listen to pre-recorded sentences (created using Speechify) and type them.
   - **Speech Practice**: Record yourself reading sentences using Python's **sounddevice** library and validate the text with **Whisper AI**.
   - Some levels combine these activities, include time limits, or have other creative challenges.

3. **Dynamic Gameplay**:
   - Levels become progressively harder as the user advances.
   - Earn stars and scores based on performance and mistakes in each level.

4. **Interactive Home Page**:
   - The home page design and game levels are customized based on the selected TV show.
